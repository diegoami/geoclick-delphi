# GEOCLICK - patched up version

It is the year 2017 and I went back to this "game" that I made in 2000-2001.

It turned out that I miss some files, so I patched it up. The file containing the executable is here : http://www.amicabile.com/software/geoclick/geoclick13-patched.zip

The game runs (almost) flawlessly under Windows 7 and 8, no idea about 10. However, make sure you read this file.

# REGISTRATION CODE

The program will ask you to register.
Just click on the credit card icon (Help/Registration) and type this

# MAPS

The game comes with few maps, as too many maps will make it crash. There are more maps here : 

http://www.amicabile.com/maps/

Just download and uncompress them in the directory where you put Geoclick. There is a function in the program to do that for you, but it does not seem to work on modern computers.

# DISACTIVATE SOUND 

It is probably a good idea to turn sound off, because WAV files may not be supported by your system. Just click on the "pencils" icon (Options/Environment) and turn sound off.

Otherwise, just click away the messagebox that appear when you start the game - they should stop popping up eventually.

# INSTRUCTIONS

As I wrote, the program is not intuitive, but there are instructions at http://www.amicabile.com/geoclick/

Common problems :
*  To select the maps you want to be asked about, go to the window under the "asterisks" icon (Option/Hotspots) 
* To start a new game click on the "Plane" (File/New game) icon

# LESSONS LEARNED

Well, I thought it was a good idea making a program to learn geography. Looking at it today, I realize that the user interface was too unintuitive and would not appeal to most people. 
I believed in it at the time, but instead I got mostly negative reviews. Now, in hindsight, I understand that this program was not good enough. Still, I had fun making it and, afterwards, using it.

I tried to sell it as shareware, but after a while I decided to give it for free, considering that cracks were available for it from the very beginning.

# BUILD THE SOFTWARE

I would not know where to begin, it would be probably better to remake the game from scratch. Actually that is the idea behind https://github.com/diegoami/geoclick , because now I would make a web application for this kind of game.

But seriously, you would need Delphi 5, and figure out what libraries should be installed. I think I included all the necessary ones, but no guarantee.
